It is not a disaster. It's not a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living soul. You wanna know why? One word: blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster - for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed! You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil! 'My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!' And the house? Gone! The feds will come in and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that, noooo. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing. And she knows it. 

Hello. Welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you. Just gonna call you Skyler if that's okay. It's a lovely name. It reminds me of the big, beautful sky. Walter always told me how lucky he was, prior to recent unfortunate events. Clearly his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers: only the very best with just the right amount of dirty. 

Walter, I'm your lawyer. Anything you say to me is totally privileged. I'm not in the shakedown racket. I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right? Especially drug dealers. 

No shit! Right now you're Fredo. But, y'know, with some sound advice and proper introductions, who knows? I'll tell you one thing: you've got the right product. Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch, you're onto something special. And I would like to be a small and silent part of it. Food for thought, yeah? So if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make, better call Saul! 

Better safe than sorry. That's my motto. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle. Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying. 

Look, let's start with some tough love, alright? Ready for this? Here it goes: you two suck at peddling meth. Period. Good! 'Oh boo-hoo, I won't cook meth anymore!' You're a crybaby! Who needs you?! Hey, I'm unplugging the website, so no more money laundering! How do you like that?! 

Great, perfect you know... this is just. I told her you were my A Team. Oh, hello Mrs. White, the good news is the IRS has been paid off, the bad news is... ach, Jesus! 

What am I eighth grade hall monitor? Current whereabouts? Let me tell you something, Mike. There are rules to this lawyer thing. Attorney client privilege, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you! If I give up Pinkman, then you're gonna be asking, old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy what's to keep him from giving me up? You see, so then, where's the trust?
